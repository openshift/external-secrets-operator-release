In order for our builds to be hermetic (without network access) we configure certain content to be prefetched using cachi2.

Refer konflux doc section on [prefetching dependencies for hermetic builds](https://konflux.pages.redhat.com/docs/users/building/prefetching-dependencies.html) for more details.
